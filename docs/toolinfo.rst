Toolinfo JSON Schema
====================
Any tool described in Toolhub has a toolinfo record containing basic
information such as the tool name and author. Tool developers can submit
externally hosted toolinfo.json files for crawling to have their contents
included in the Toolhub catalog. Toolinfo.json files must conform to
a published JSON schema to be indexed successfully.
