Example Toolhub OAuth client
============================

This application is a minimal example of how to use the OAuth authorization
server embedded in Toolhub to build a client application.

Usage
-----
This is a bit of a bother, but hey it is a testing rig and at this point it is
exciting that it is even possible.

1. Use the `POST /api/oauth/applications/` endpoint to create new application
   grant for your test app.

2. Copy the `client_id` and `client_secret` generated by the API into your
   `.env` configuration file:

   TOOLHUB_CLIENT_ID={client_id value}
   TOOLHUB_CLIENT_SECRET={client_secret value}

3. Use `make oauth-client` to start a docker-compose container running this
   application. By default it will be exposed as http://localhost:8002/.
